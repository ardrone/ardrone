 *   To help others to understand the kalman filter, I used one of     *
 *   the most accessible sources with information on it:               *
 *   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter                        *
 *   The code is split into 2 parts: a Predict function and an         *
 *   Update function, just as the wikipedia page does.                 *
 *   The model I used in the kalman filter is the following:           *
 *   Our gyroscope measures the turnrate in degrees per second. This   *
 *   is the derivative of the angle, called dotAngle. The bias is the  *
 *   output of our gyro when the rotationrate is 0 degrees per second  *
 *   (not rotating). Because of drift it changes over time.            *
 *   So mathematically we just integrate the gyro (dt is timespan      *
 *   since last integration):                                          *
 *              angle = angle + (dotAngle - bias) * dt                 *
 *   When we include the bias in our model, the kalman filter will     *
 *   try to estimate the bias, thanks to our last input: the measured  *
 *   angle. This is just an estimate and comes from the accelerometer. *
 *   So the state used in our filter had 2 dimensions: [ angle, bias ] *
 *   Jump to the functions to read more about the actual               *
 *   implementation.                                                   *
 *                                                                     *
